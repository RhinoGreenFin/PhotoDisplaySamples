Simple code examples of photo displays 

Description 
====================

 This is just a couple pages that will display the top 20 images from a facebook login. 1.) displays timer for images and rotates through the images. 2.) Photo gallery displaying image-background so each images are same size. Hover functionality. .on Click event for displaying full image. 

Test notes: 
===================

    * When you hover over the images in the gallery they get very jittery when moving at certain angles. 
    * Bad functionality to click and open image up in location.window. Will update to a modal image click popout. 
    * The images will be distorted if they are not the exact size. It would be better to scale the images first.
